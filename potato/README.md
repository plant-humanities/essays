Woven into the history of the potato, from its Indigenous domestication in the Andes to its prevalence in diets around the world today, are the contrasting themes of comedy and tragedy, sustenance and toxicity, manna and misery. Playful and comedic interpretations of the potato abound, as seen in the cartoon by Alfred Le Petit from the 1871 collection *Fleurs, Fruits & Legumes Du Jour*. It lampoons Pierre-Frédéric Dorian, the French Minister of Public Works, by likening him to the humble and earthen tuber.  Translated into English, the text reads, “While the poet wanders in vain through the ether, Dorian acts, as everyone knows; In the reality which we find ourselves in, one can never be too much a man of the earth” (*homme de terre*). The clever wordplay of *homme de terre*/*pomme de terre* (French for potato) alludes to Dorian’s role in weapons manufacturing and policy; unlike poets, he is a grounded person of action—or so one might think. Despite his prominence in the politics of defense, Dorian refused to take a position during the popular uprisings of October 31, 1870, which likely accounts for his inclusion in this 1871 satirical publication.

In sharp contrast to the humorous irreverence of Le Petit, the realm of caricature art also yields potent depictions of the suffering and privation associated with the potato. In Honoré Daumier’s illustrations, the archetypal Irishman is shown as emaciated, ravaged by the 1845–1852 potato famine, and presented in juxtaposition to caricatures of England’s John Bull as a plump colonial oppressor.

Daumier’s work serves as a provocative interjection by another national entity, France, into the fraught space of the Britain-Ireland dialectic, presumably to reinforce and promote France and its republican, anti-monarchist ideals.[^1] In this way, the caricatures suggest a connection between the potato and events of transnational significance that this essay will explore.

Over the millennia, the potato has been the subject of diverse associations, meanings, and values. This multivalence is a product of societal context, and this essay will examine the perceptions and role of the potato in different societies including South America prior to European colonization, Great Britain, France, the United States, as well as through the broader lens of contemporary transnationalism. During the colonization of the Americas, the potato—along with other plants of dietary and economic value—underwent a transatlantic migration that saw its introduction to Europe. In the wake of this, attempts to integrate the potato into the fabric of European agriculture and food consumption were met with fierce resistance and debate across the social spectrum.

These controversies saw the potato cast in terms of the perennial conflict between nature and culture. In contrast to bread, the archetypal staple food and staff of life, the potato was viewed as dangerously organic and chthonic, representative of the threat posed by disordered nature to culture and civilization.[^2] Well-intentioned efforts to combat food scarcity and promote the nutritional value of the potato clashed with ingrained attitudes that stigmatized the tuber as unhealthy, inferior to wheaten bread, and a danger to ordered society. Today, science seeks to ameliorate the vulnerability intrinsic to the potato—and which is largely responsible for its tragic associations—by introducing genetic material from wild relatives endemic to Latin America. That the potato has long been implicated in global movement, migration, and profound historical change speaks to the potential for plants to serve as archives in their own right.

The potato plays a significant role in the histories of famine and social inequality, poverty and migration, war and colonialism. In its native range, the potato’s singular capacity to mobilize labor enabled the consolidation of Incan imperial power; on a global scale, it helped fuel European conquest and colonialism.[^3] Historical tragedies such the Irish Great Famine have cemented the potato’s association with hardship and suffering in the collective imagination, a theme that persists in narratives of refugees and internment camps. These tangled social and cultural histories compel us to interrogate how one plant, taking root in different societal contexts, has come to embody such contrasting associations.

## The British Potato Debates

The potato arrived in Europe via Spanish sailors, and from the Basque provinces it spread through northern Italy, the Low Countries (including Flanders and the Southern Netherlands), Franche Comté, Alsace, and the Rhineland. Basque fishermen introduced the potato to Ireland. Generally, its diffusion followed the Spanish Road linking Spain’s territories in Northern Italy and the Low Countries. The potato’s introduction to central and northern Europe followed on the heels of the Thirty Years’ War (1618–1648) and it was embraced by peasants who celebrated its capacity to evade military requisitioning, unlike grain.[^16] This potential to alleviate the threat of civilian starvation is referred to by Nally and Kearns as “survival ecology.”[^17] However, the potato’s association with peasants and subsistence farming became a stigma, and it emerged as a target for debates about poverty and class.

In England in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, economists and agricultural theorists were mired in what came to be known as the potato debate. The crux of the debate was the perceived juxtaposition between potatoes and grain, with ramifications for English peasants and direct relevance to the history of British colonial rule in Ireland. Some argued that potatoes came from the earth and were consumed in their natural state, unlike bread, which was the finished product of a complex process through which raw nature was transformed. Some thus considered bread to be a symbol of culture and community. In contrast, those who depended on potatoes—as was the case with the Irish—were seen as being closely bound to the soil and estranged from culture.[^18] In reality, English peasants consumed potatoes as well, and a 1796 guide  to their cultivation testifies to their importance in northern England, especially in Lancaster: “Potatoes are the chief maintenance of the lower classes of people here.” Despite contemporary attitudes espoused by the debates, the author went on to claim that “They are also in great estimation amongst persons of higher rank.” The author stipulated, however, that “Notwithstanding the excellent qualities peculiar to this root, the uses of it have not been well understood, nor the cultivation of it much practised in the southern counties of England.”[^19]  Despite its cultivation and consumption in England, disparaging the potato and those who consumed it became a convenient means of suggesting English cultural superiority over the Irish.

Among the debaters, the potato also bore an unwelcome association with Irish Catholicism and its “ineradicability.” Like the faith of the Irish people it sustained, the tuber was able to resist destruction and maintain its “subterranean vitality.”[^20] In the eyes of the English, the Irish people—who ate potatoes and also believed they consumed the body of Christ in the form of the Communion wafer—were seen as embodying two extremes of backwardness: the tuber’s “degrading carnality” and the Host’s false transcendence.[^21] In addition, the potato’s vulnerability to disease rendered it a symbol of “biological uncertainty,” a reminder of human frailty and mortality, and by extension, the uncertainty embedded in an economy dependent upon human bodies.[^22]

The potato debaters rejected the earlier efforts of agricultural reformers like Arthur Young, who sought to promote acceptance of the potato and its cultivation on private allotments of land to feed the lower classes. Those who opposed Young’s Enlightenment ideals feared that his plans for its cultivation would position the potato—and those who consumed it—outside of the population-regulating apparatus of the grain economy. The potato patch was thought to encourage unchecked population growth among the lower classes and the proliferation of an unproductive labor pool.[^23] Young’s opponents often subscribed to a new set of capitalistic values that cast traditional subsistence practices as pernicious and slothful rather than tenacious and resourceful.[^24] Descriptions of the Irish peasantry from the 1770s—1830s are lurid exercises in conveying abjection and extreme poverty, though such accounts were evidently motivated by divergent goals. To support his reform agenda, Young detailed the conditions he found in the “miserable-looking hovels” he encountered during his travels in Ireland, painting a picture of smoky, windowless, and rudimentary living quarters in which humans and animals cohabitated.[^25]

William Cobbett, a journalist with sensationalist instincts and one of the most ardent opponents of the potato, spoke of “miserable shed[s]” and “holes” where people lived and dined, alongside their livestock, on potatoes: “nasty, filthy hog-feed.”[^26] Cobbett’s dehumanizing language portrays potato eaters as scarcely better than animals, living in filth and misery.

In keeping with these sentiments, Cobbett opens his entry on the potato in *The English Gardener* by stating unequivocally that the potato is to be used “merely in company with meat, and not to be used as a substitute for bread…as a substitute for bread, it is the most wasteful thing that can possibly be used.” Far from being suitable for human consumption, he considered potatoes to be “inferior” livestock feed compared to a host of other vegetables.[^27]

In general, the reliance by Irish Catholic peasants on potatoes contrasted with the diets of Protestant landowners, who were influenced by English gardening practices and cultivated a diversity of crops on their estates, thus—by their perspective—improving the land and taking advantage of its productivity.[^28] The class division evident in gardening and cultivation practices comported with an enduring, biblical-tinged rhetoric about the Irish peasant classes dating back to the seventeenth century. In the eyes of English contemporaries, Ireland was untamed, unbroken nature, like Eden before the Fall, its bounties unharnessed by a sybaritic, unindustrious populace.[^29] This view served to justify the negative characterizations of the Irish given voice in the potato debates. Controversy surrounding the potato also linked back to traditional food culture in Europe, which held that vegetables that grew under the ground were the lowliest sort of food.[^30] During the Industrial Revolution, potatoes would come to be embraced by employers: as cheap and plentiful foodstuff, it enabled them to justify paying workers the lowest living wage.[^31]

## New Food for a New Republic: The Potato in France

The anxieties, uncertainties, and contradictions wrapped up in the potato, which obstructed its mainstream acceptance in Britain, were echoed in France. French efforts to promote the potato as a substitute for bread were perceived as an extension of Enlightenment thinking: the triumph of science and reason over superstition and deeply ingrained foodways. The charge was led by the pharmacist and food scientist Antoine-Augustin Parmentier, in the context of food riots and new empirical approaches to nutrition and diet in the 1760s and 1770s. Driven by widespread food insecurity and the goal of identifying bread substitutes, advances in food chemistry enabled the isolation of compounds such as gluten and starch from wheat and potatoes. Parmentier made waves by claiming that starch was the ideal “alimentary substance,” rather than gluten, at a time when bread was considered the God-given food of the French people.[^32]
<param ve-image

       caption="François Dumont, *Antoine Parmentier (1737-1813)*, 1812. Wikimedia Commons.">

In 1779, Parmentier published the treatise, *Method of making bread from potatoes, without adding flour* (*Manière de faire le pain de pommes de terre, sans mélange de farine*), in which he elaborated on the results of his experiments in baking pure potato bread, which had been thought impossible.[^33] As one of the virtues of making bread from potatoes he cited the utter self-sufficiency involved in the operation: “all is under the control of he who makes potato bread, & the process will not be difficult, once one acquires the skill.” Unlike when milling grain into flour, one does not have to rely on the “discretion of an unfaithful or inept miller.” To make bread from grain, one must contend with the “distance to the mills, the time that one loses by going there to wait one’s turn and mind one’s grain, and the necessity of keeping the flour for a certain time in order to use it with some profit.”[^34] One does not have to worry about any of these obstacles when one makes potato bread. Strikingly, the characteristics that Parmentier applauds in the potato—self-reliance, self-containment, the lack of a social, communal dimension—are the same traits that the English anti-potato faction singled out to condemn the potato.

To win over the public to the potato, Parmentier first sought to promote its charms among the highest social stratum. He invited renowned economists and agronomists to elaborate potato dinners and attended the court of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette, where he presented the rulers with a bouquet of potato flowers.[^35] Given these attentions, it is perhaps ironic that Parmentier’s attempts to gain the potato greater acceptance among French people, mainly Parisians, coincided with the waning of the Old Regime and the seismic social and political shifts instigated by the French Revolution. The potato’s subsequent widespread adoption in France accompanied the creation of the new Republic. The covenant between rulers and the people—formerly consecrated by the guarantee of bread—had been broken, leaving room for new food alternatives, such as the potato, to take root.[^36] In *Feeding France*, Emma Spary suggests that those who advocated for dietary alternatives to wheat and bread, such as Parmentier, “contributed…to the erosion of the Old Regime.”[^37]

## Underground Subsistence: The Low Countries and Central Europe

Narratives of the potato’s adoption in Europe are not without ambiguity. While Enlightenment thinkers such as Young and Parmentier doubtless played a significant role, one would be remiss to discount the efforts of peasants across Europe, who took the initiative to cultivate this “migrant vegetable.”[^38] As Europe moved away from traditional agrarian society, and land was parceled out and commodified under a new economic order, it became necessary to adopt a means of subsistence that required little land for productivity. Nally and Kearns invoke the research of Rebecca Earle to argue the significance of this overlooked narrative: “As peasants became proletarians the potato rose in importance as both a lifeline and an enabler; it allowed workers to survive on the little land left to them and it enabled their social reproduction from extremely meager resources.”[^39] The authors also cite the potato’s essential “furtive” quality as facilitating its embrace by peasant communities; by remaining concealed belowground, it enabled their survival and persistence during times of conflict, when armies would commandeer aboveground food resources.[^40] This was especially true in Alsace, “nearly always the primary theater of war in Europe,” as well as the Low Countries.[^41] Indeed, the Netherlands by the 1840s were distinguished by potato cultivation and consumption, like Ireland, and like Ireland, the potato in the Netherlands came to be associated with poverty and famine.[^42] The potato’s role in early modern Europe bespeaks its paradoxical connotations of resilience and vulnerability. It possesses the unique ability to thrive in almost any environment, no matter how hostile the soil to other crops, and could be grown in surreptitious locations such as riverbanks and ditches.[^43]

## The Irish Famine

That the potato could be tied up in globally consequent social change is nowhere more evident than in Ireland. The Irish Potato Famine of 1845–1852 marked the culmination of a centuries-long fraught relationship between its land and people, a history of disenfranchisement from which the potato was inextricable. In the aftermath of the Cromwellian wars, Irish land dispossession under the Commonwealth Acts of 1652 and 1653 precipitated a shift in the Irish people’s relationship to the potato as a source of food.[^44] While the potato had been cultivated in Ireland as a food crop for several generations, the Commonwealth Acts forced the Irish to accept the potato as their primary source of sustenance.[^45] Prior to these legislative measures, English military campaigns—which aimed to anglicize Ireland and brutally suppress rebellion—routinely implemented scorched-earth tactics that destroyed crops and left people starving.[^46] Salaman addresses the Irish tragedy at length in his book, arguing a complicity between the potato’s domination of Irish diets and the continuation of the cottier system, in which all land was held by Anglo-Saxon landlords. The latter was responsible for the poverty of the vast majority of Irish people and by extension, the magnitude of devastation wrought by the famine.[^47] He traces a merciless and unremitting cycle whereby the sole reliance on potato cultivation, which reduces the cost of living and labor to their lowest point, perpetuates poverty, and vice versa: “It is not too much to say that for close on 300 years the potato both stabilized and perpetuated the misery of the Irish masses.”[^48] Nally and Kearns sum up the pre-famine situation in Ireland by writing, “the wretched cottier and the mighty landlord were bound together by the material affordances of this migrant vegetable.”[^49]

It is worth noting that the Irish had become exclusively dependent on a small number of potato varieties, in particular the blight-prone variety called “Lumper.”[^50] The blight, caused by the infection of potato plants by the Phytophthora infestans fungus, affected potato crops throughout Western Europe. However, only in Ireland did it precipitate the Great Famine, characterized by immense suffering, the death of over one million people, and the subsequent mass migration of over two million Irish people, particularly to North America.[^51] The potato is intertwined with two parallel histories of transatlantic movement: the first, the exchange of food crops—notably the potato—between the Americas and Eurasia, and the second, the migration of Irish people to America. The latter had historical and social reverberations not only for Ireland, but also for the development of the United States.
